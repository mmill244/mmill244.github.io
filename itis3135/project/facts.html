            <h2>Facts About Women in STEM</p>

            <h3>24% of STEM students are women</h3>
            <p>The number of women studying STEM is increasing but so is the number of men studying STEM. This keeps the proportion of women studying STEM low and the gender gap in STEM persisiting.</p>
        
            <h3>Women make up a fourth of the US STEM workforce</h3>
            <p>In 1970, 8% of STEM workers were women. In 2020, that percentage had increased to 29% and only 19.2% of board positions were held by women. </p>
        
            <h3>Women are leaving STEM jobs</h3>
            <p>The lack of women in STEM can also be associated with the fact that women leave STEM jobs more often than men do. Women can leave for a number of reasons but some of them include isolation, hostile work environment, and ineffective responses to feedback. </p>

            <h3>The Wage Gap in STEM</h3>
            <p>STEM fields have less of a wage gap than the US average, but there still is a definitive gap. Research shows that in some fields, female workers could make 30% less than their male coworkers.</p>
