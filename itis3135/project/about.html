            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Maggie Wyatt. I am currently a Mechanical/Plumbing Designer for a consulting firm in Charlotte, NC. I do mechanical, plumbing, and fire protection design for commercial buildings including healthcare facilities. I  graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in May of 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in energy, and a minor in mathematics. I have an interest in the future of energy production, specifically renewable resources and improving energy system efficiency.</p>
