        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
            <a href="https://www.pennyjuice.com/" class="a1">Penny Juice Website</a>
                <p>Penny Juice is a website that is selling juice for children.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast: The Home page of the website has texts over a picture. The contrast of the picture is contrasts too much with the text over it.</li>
                        <li>Repititon: The color scheme of this site has too many colors going on. They have a few colors they use more than once, but they all clash.</li>
                        <li>Alignment: The alignment of text and pictures on this site go well together, however the amount of things going on is confusing. </li>
                        <li>Proximity: The proximity on this site is not horrible, but it is also not great. I do not like the text over pictures that is demonstrated at the top of the page. The image running along the bottom of the page is also very close to the items above it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" class="a1">Apple iPad Pro Website</a>
                <p>Apple's page for their iPad Pro is a fun, interactive page. As you scroll through the page, the text moves, pictures appear, and other graphic designs details pop up.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast: The background is black, all text is either white or colorful.</li>
                        <li>Repition: The same font and color scheme is used throughout the page.</li>
                        <li>Alignment: The alignment for this page is mainly centered, but there are a few places where the alignment changes.</li>
                        <li>Proximity: All informaiton is spaced out enough that nothing feels like it is overlapping or too close to other information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
