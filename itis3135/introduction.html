        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: I've lived in Concord, NC my entire life. I am an only child, I love to read, and have 5 cats.</li>
            <li>Professional: I don't have much of a professional background. I started working in the food service industry when I turned 16. I did that up until the beginning of last summer where I then went and worked at a summer camp.</li>
            <li>Academic background: I am a senior majoring in Math and minoring in Data Science. I briefly was an Education major but switched out of that once I started taking Computer Science courses (I liked comsci so much more!)</li>
            <li>Information/Technology background: I've used computers my whole life. I don't know how to fix one or do anything advanced.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: The only coding experience I have is from my courses here at UNCC. I have experience using Java and SQL. I'm currently taking two courses that use Python, so I am learning a little bit of that.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Macbook Air M1</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking and reason for each: 
                <ul>
                    <li>MATH 4228 - Actuarial Science IIA - I'm getting a Actuarial Science certificate along with my major, so this is a required class.</li>
                    <li>ITCS 3162 - Introduction to Data Mining - for my minor!</li>
                    <li>ITCS 3190 - Cloud Computing for Data Analysis - also taking for minor</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 - Web Design & Development - just sounds really cool</li>
                    <li>ITSC 2214 - Data Structures and Algorithms - I took this course last semester and now I'm a TA for the course!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                I am a huge booknerd and am always reading. I even have a bookstagram! </li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                Since taking my first computer science course, I've been diving into all the comsci classes that I find interesting! This happens to be one of them!</li>
        </ul>
